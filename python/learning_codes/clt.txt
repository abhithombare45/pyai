Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in Machine Learning

What is CLT?

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that:

	If we take a large number of random samples from any population (regardless of its original distribution), the distribution of the sample means will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size increases.

Mathematically:

If ￼ are independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with:
	•	Mean ￼
	•	Standard deviation ￼

Then, the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows:
￼
where ￼ is the standard error.

When to Use CLT in Machine Learning?
	1.	Feature Scaling & Data Normalization
	•	Some ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM) assume normally distributed features.
	•	CLT allows us to assume approximate normality if we use aggregated data or large samples.
	2.	Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Inference
	•	Used in A/B testing, confidence intervals, t-tests, and p-value calculations.
	•	Helps in estimating population parameters using a sample.
	3.	Bootstrap Sampling in ML
	•	Bootstrapping involves repeatedly sampling data with replacement and calculating sample statistics.
	•	CLT ensures that the mean of bootstrap samples follows a normal distribution, helping estimate uncertainty in model parameters.
	4.	Resampling Techniques (Cross-Validation, Bagging)
	•	ML models like Random Forest, Bagging classifiers rely on sampling.
	•	CLT helps in understanding the distribution of errors across multiple model runs.
	5.	Parameter Estimation in Bayesian Methods
	•	CLT helps approximate posterior distributions as normal in Bayesian Inference.
	6.	Anomaly Detection & Outlier Analysis
	•	If the feature follows CLT, extreme values deviating from normality can be treated as anomalies.

Key Takeaway

CLT is widely used in ML for data normalization, hypothesis testing, resampling methods, and uncertainty estimation. It ensures that sample means are normally distributed, allowing for robust statistical inference.
